==== HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN GOPHERHOLE =========================

So. You also want to make a gopherhole? Today I'm going to be 
telling you how to do it! Lets get started!

STEP 1: GET A VPS OR SERVER

To run a gopherhole, you need a server, just like hosting a 
normal website. If the hosting company of your choosing doesn't
have gopher servers, just get a VPS.

STEP 2: INSTALLING PYGOPHERD

To run a Gopherdserver you are gonna need a few things:

- Python 2 or higher
- The pygopherd package
- Text editor like vim or nano

All these packages should be in the default repos.
So install them with:

sudo apt install python pygopherd vim

STEP 3: RUNNING PYGOPHERD

To run, stop or restart pygoperd, use these commands:

sudo /etc/init.d/pygopherd start
sudo /etc/init.d/pygopherd stop
sudo /etc/init.d/pygopherd restart

STEP 4: CONFIGURE GOPHERMAP

When starting your gopherhole, you should get a default
page telling you what to do next.
In short, open the terminal, and type:

sudo nano /var/gopher/gophermap

Then just build your gopherhole landingpage.
I hope this helps!
