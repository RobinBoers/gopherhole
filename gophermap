===== WELCOME TO MY GOPHERHOLE! ===============================

Hi! I'm Robin Boers, and I am a 13 years old teenager from the
Netherlands, who loves programming and thinkering with computers.

This is my gopherhole. A gopherhole is a website using the old
gopher protecol. Its just made up out of plain text, but I really
like it. This is my little place to experiment with stuff.

===== BLOG ====================================================

I'm soon going to be starting a little blog here. I already
have a blog on the normal Interwebs, which you can find here:

==== WHY GOPHER? =============================================

Gopher is a alternative to the http protocol, designed in the
90's. It uses just plain text, and is very quick. A modern
webbrowser takes up much of your rescources. It's not unusual
for Chrome to take up more than 1GB of RAM. 

The normal web is cool, and it is fun to built websites with
HTML, CSS and JavaScript! But it is also cool to see this
alternative way of communication. Gopher sites (called 
gopherholes) don't have annoying pop-ups, and they don't
track you, nor do they steal your data.
